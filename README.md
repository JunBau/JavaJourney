This will store projects I've been working on for Java, both using courses and a seperate section for things that I just wanted to create.

Also using this to practice BASH and using GIT.

The content from CourseProjects/JavaPrograms are from a the Java Masterclass course from Tim Buchalka's course:-

Extremely useful and fun course to learn about Java. Highly recommend it!
